## Introduction
The historic data consists of 1% random samples from the deorphaned population
The 1% random sample is chosen independently every week .
We have 68 samples (see dates at the end) but we do not need to keep them all.
A dictionary for the fields can be found here: http://gecko.readthedocs.io/en/latest/toolkit/components/telemetry/healthreport/index.html
